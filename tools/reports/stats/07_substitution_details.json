You also must get the best quality of meat and let the butcher know that you will be consuming the meat raw. Eating raw meat in NOT gross. Alot of people - mostly of European/Asian/African decent eat meat raw and ENJOY it. I personaly eat steak tartar, and a version made of pork (YES raw pork!) but I only buy it from one German butcher in Toronto and consume it right away on fresh bread. I also eat an Ethiopan dish of raw cubed steak in a spicy sauce and sushi with raw fish. YUM!!!! Befor you start slaming food, you should try it. There are far more non North Americans who eat raw meat than North Americans who don't.",
