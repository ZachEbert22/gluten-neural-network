We actually got about 6 gyros out of this recipe, maybe our pita bread was smaller. For that amount of chicken, next time I'd probably make a half a cup of yogurt so there wasn't so much left over. Oh, and we didn't do the aluminum foil thing either, it wasn't that messy. We also topped ours with lettuce and green peppers just because we had some. VERY GOOD!!",

I used reduced fat cheese because that&#039;s what I accidentally picked up at the store, but next time I will probably use full-fat cheese for better texture (reduced fat cheese wasn&#039;t too bad, but texture was a bit rubbery -- my fault, not the recipe&#039;s). I only got 4 servings out of this, not 9 -- maybe it would serve 9 as small pieces on a breakfast buffet with other items. I actually enjoyed this warm as breakfast, and then another piece at room temp for dinner. Very good both ways. Thanks for posting! Made for PAC Spring 2014",

First of all, you dont brush the chicken with olive oil, but with a grill baste. the baste is primarily equal parts pomace olive oil and butter, balsamic vinegar, a splash of white wine vinegar, garlic, and a bit of parsely.  The seasoning is not just salt and pepper, but rather salt, black pepper, dried oregano, crushed red pepper and dried basil.  As far as the lemon butter, the recipe IS correct, except you need twice the amount of butter as described.  That is why it tastes so harsh when made by this recipe.  Also, as an important note, when making your reduction for the lemon butter sauce, you need to reduce it until it looks like oatmeal and begins to carmalize slightly. Then, while the reduction is still hot add your butter SLOWLY at first, and once the emulsion begins to take form you can add the rest of the butter.  How do I know? I used to work there.",

Maybe I did something wrong, but these came out almost more like crepes than the buttermilk panckes I'm used to (i.e. light and fluffy). The batter was very thin and didn't puff up like I thought it would. I offered to make them with chocolate chips or bananas, but no takers so we just had plain pancakes. DH had his with real maple syrup and lil' sis and I just had ours plain. They didn't seem like they needed any more butter with all of the butter in the batter and then being cooked in butter. This was better than the last pancake recipe I tried, but I'm starting to think I'm incapable of making normal, American pancakes from scratch.",
