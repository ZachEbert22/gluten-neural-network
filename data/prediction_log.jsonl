These are by far the very best oatmeal cookies that I have ever tried! I could not keep my kids, my husband and myself away from them! I sent a plate over to my mom and dads - a short while later she said that they were gone. I used regular salted stick butter - so I left the kosher salt out. Some of us don't care for raisins so I left them out this time. I also added cinnamon and dipped the tops of the cookies in sugar! I don't like cookies that are too hard - these are so delicious and so chewy - THEY ARE PERFECTION!!What can I say they are AWESOME! You could not get a better cookie at any bakery. I will definately try with raisins for my husband next time. Thanks for sharing this AWESOME recipe with us!", "status": "gluten_free"}], "rewritten": ""}

For the glaze, since I didn't have pecans or bittersweet chocolate, I mixed about a cup of confect. sugar and 4 heaping Tbsp. of cocoa powder, I then added some lime juice, zest and a little milk until I got the consistency I wanted. I also spooned some cajeta over the top of the cake after I was done frosting and some lime zest. Tasted great! Thank you for posting this recipe!
